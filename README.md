# ML-for-prediction
This repository provides a few examples on feature analysis, statistic analysis and ML model training and testing with an open-source drilling dataset
It uses a well drilling log data from Volve field (open source data), analyzes the data and features statistically, and works on training various machine learning models for ROP prediction
